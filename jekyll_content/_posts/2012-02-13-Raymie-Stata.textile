h1. Some tech roles:

* Managers:
** manage commitment. People depend on product, they make it happen on time.

* Individual Contributor (ic):
** i shaped

* Architects:
** t shaped


* There are some companies that don't have an architect branch. (google)


h1. More in depth about Architect:

* It's all about *managing trade offs*

* tech debt: making not-the-most-elegant solution and deciding to leave
the elegant solution for the future. Customers will never be happy
about paying down the debt, they want solutions.

* need to understand how software evolves over time. Understand how to
get what you want done working with what you've already got.

* Startups: they don't teach you how get things done in large
companies.

* As an architect people have to trust that you're doing the best for
the company, not just your career.
