This is Diego's homepage. 

It uses Jekyll, the static site generator, in an attempt to keep it clean and simple.

This is how you build it:

    sudo docker build -t godiego-org ./
    sudo docker tag godiego-org us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod
    gcloud docker push us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod
    kubectl rolling-update godiego-controller --image=us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod

Note that tag name above must be different from what's currently live.
