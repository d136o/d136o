This is Diego's homepage. 

It uses Jekyll, the static site generator, in an attempt to keep it clean and simple.

This is how you build it:

    sudo docker build -t godiego-org ./
    sudo docker tag godiego-org us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod
    gcloud docker push us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod
    kubectl rolling-update godiego-controller --image=us.gcr.io/godiego-org/prod

Note that tag name above must be different from what's currently live.

To develop locally docker build the image and then run:

To 

    docker run -it -v $godiego_org_home:/tmp/godiego-org:rw --publish=127.0.0.1:4000:4000 --publish=127.0.0.1:80:80 --name="removeme" test bin/bash

Then:
    # source /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm
    # cd /tmp/godiego-org/projects/godiego-org/godiego-org-original/jekyll_content
    # jekyll serve -H 0.0.0.0 -w
    


Common errors:

If you're not running docker 24/7:
