I'm a Computer Science student graduating in 2012. In terms of academics, I tried out many subjects during my undergrad years. I did lab work for two summers, one in an evolutionary biology lab, and another in a biophysics lab. Then I tried physics out, but really it takes a lot to be a mad scientist. Finally, I decided to settle on CS after spending a summer coding with two great friends. During the summer of 2011 I was learning and programming for a great startup, "wattvision.com":http://wattvision.com .

I'm interested in all things tech/science and am a big fan of xkcd.
